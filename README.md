The bike-sharing demand project and the heart disease prediction project are both team efforts completed by me and two of my classmates at NYU GPH, Helen Liang and Xiaotong Zhao. 
As a courtesy to their contributions, the Rmd code files show the parts completed by me, while the PDF files contain the complete projects.
